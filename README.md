# Object Detection with OpenCV and MobileNet SSD

This repository contains a Python script for performing object detection on an input image using OpenCV and the MobileNet SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) model trained on the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset. The script detects objects in the image and draws bounding boxes around them, along with labels indicating the detected objects and their confidence scores.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-detection-opencv.git
